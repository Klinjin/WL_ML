The Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the competition will have separate leaderboards. We will award the monetory prizes to the top performers in either phases of the competition.

For the **Phase 1**, the top three performers will be awarded the following prizes:

ðŸ¥‡ First Place: $2,000

ðŸ¥ˆ Second Place: $1500

ðŸ¥‰ Third Place: $500

We will announce the prize for the **Phase 2** soon. 

Eligibility is determined by the Terms and Conditions that all participants must agree with to enter the challenge.

In addition to monetary prizes, a jury will evaluate models for which a short write-up will have been submitted. The models will be evaluated in terms of score, practicality, frugality in terms of resources and novelty.

The special jury prizes will be funded invitations to NeurIPS 2025, to talk during the dedicated session of the competitions workshop.

NOTE: A single user or team will only be awarded one prize.
